echo 
1. prints single words 
2. can print variables which aredefined using $
-> excludes "____" , handles printing of variables using $x


pwd 
1. pwd &t: prints the COMPLETE location of the current working directory 
2. pwd --help &t: prints the help page and availiable command of the pwd command 
-> exception handled: 'pwd --' is same as pwd , gives error of too many arguments if too many arguments given 
EXAMPLE: 
| pwd         
/Users/utkarsh/Desktop/TER/untitled folder
| pwd --help
pwd: pwd [-LP]
	Print the name of the current working directory.

	Options:
	 -l  	print the value of $PWD if it names the current working
			directory
	 -P 	print the phystcal directory, without any symboltc links
	
	By default, "pwd' behaves as if '-L' were specified.

	Exit Status:
	Returns 0 unless an invalid option is given or the current directory cannot be read.
| pwd &t
/Users/utkarsh/Desktop/TER/untitled folder
| pwd --help &t
pwd: pwd [-LP]
	Print the name of the current working directory.

	Options:
	 -l  	print the value of $PWD if it names the current working
			directory
	 -P 	print the phystcal directory, without any symboltc links
	
	By default, "pwd' behaves as if '-L' were specified.

	Exit Status:
	Returns 0 unless an invalid option is given or the current directory cannot be read.
| pwd --
/Users/utkarsh/Desktop/TER/untitled folder
| pwd -- &t
/Users/utkarsh/Desktop/TER/untitled folder
| pwd eifj
pwd: too many arguments
| pwd ufh &t
pwd: too many arguments





ls
1. ls -a &t : prints all files in the directory including the hidden files 
2. ls &t : prints all the file names which are are present in the current directory 
-> 'ls --' is treated the same as ls , if an invalid filename is written alongside ls tell the user that no such file/ directory exists eg: 'ls rufh &t' outputs 'ls: No such file or directory exists' warning




date 
1. date &t: outputs the local (IST) time
2. date -u &t: outputs the UTC time
-> date -uuuuu still works as date -u , wrong command with date eg: date -r gives incorrect arguments and prompts the user about what the right arguments are
EXAMPLE
| date
| IST Tue Oct 25 14:48:32 2022
date -u
| UTC Tue Oct 25 09:18:36 2022
date &t
IST Tue Oct 25 14:48:46 2022
| date -u &t
UTC Tue Oct 25 09:18:58 2022
| date -uuuu
| UTC Tue Oct 25 09:19:20 2022
date -uuuu &t
UTC Tue Oct 25 09:19:25 2022
| date -r
date: illegal option
usage: date [-jnRu] [-d dst] [-r seconds] [-t west] [-v[+|-]val[ymwdHMS]] ... 
	[-f fmt date | [[[mm]dd]HH]MM[[cc]yy][.ss]] [+format]
| date -r &t
date: illegal option
usage: date [-jnRu] [-d dst] [-r seconds] [-t west] [-v[+|-]val[ymwdHMS]] ... 
	[-f fmt date | [[[mm]dd]HH]MM[[cc]yy][.ss]] [+format]




rm 
1. rm xyz &t: removes file with filename xyz
2. rm -i xyz &t: removes file with file name xyz if the user says yes
-> most corner cases related to rm are handled due to the implementation 



mkdir 
1. mkdir xyz &t : makes directory with the name xyz
2. mkdir --help &t : prints help file for mkdir and outputs the various commands
-> most of the corner cases are handled due to the implementation 



cat 
1. cat xyz &t : opens and prints the text of the file named xyz
2. cat abc xyz &t : opens and prints the text of the files abc and xyz 
-> if file xyz is not found in the directory gives the output 'cat: ejhf: No such file or directory' , if the file you try to open is a cat then it gives out the output 'cat: filename: Is a directory'



cd 
INCOMPLETE

FORK AND EXEC GUIDE
-------------------


1. Echo 
FUNCTIONALITIES 
printing out lines of code
printing out variables and declaring variablesâ€¨CORNER CASES
scanf only scans the first word but echo can scan entire line hence this corner case is handled
if starting and ending with inverted quotes only the text in the middle of the 2 double quotes is printed 
eg: 
% echo utkarsh
utkarsh
% echo "utkarsh"
utkarsh
% x= 5
echo the value of x is $x
the value of x is 5
% echo you need me i dont need you
you need me i dont need you


2. Date 
FUNCTIONALITIES
date : prints the current local time 
date -u : prints the UTC time
CORNER CASES HANDLED
if the command date -uuuu... is given it still reads it as date -u ie: only the first character after - is read, this corner case is handled.
if any unrecognized date command is called eg: date -r gives out an error 
"usage: date [-jnRu] [-d dst] [-r seconds] [-t west] [-v[+|-]val[ymwdHMS]] ... 
            [-f fmt date | [[[mm]dd]HH]MM[[cc]yy][.ss]] [+format]"
this case is also covered
eg:
% date -uuu
UTC Sun Oct 23 10:59:36 2022
% date -u
UTC Sun Oct 23 10:59:38 2022
% date
IST Sun Oct 23 16:29:32 2022
% date -r
date: illegal option
usage: date [-jnRu] [-d dst] [-r seconds] [-t west] [-v[+|-]val[ymwdHMS]] ... 
	[-f fmt date | [[[mm]dd]HH]MM[[cc]yy][.ss]] [+format]



3. pwd
FUNCTIONALITIES
pwd : prints the 'COMPLETE' path of the current working directory 
pwd --help : shows info about the various commands and flags of the pwd command 
pwd -- : command is equivalent to normal pwd command
CORNER CASES HANDLED
"pwd --" command is treated equivalent to the normal "pwd" command this corner case is handled
if the number of arguments are more than permitted then the pwd command points out the error by giving out "pwd: too many arguments" ie: the issue of too many arguments being given in pwd is sorted 



4. rm 
FUNCTIONALITIES
rm xyz: deletes the file with the file name as  'xyz'
rm -i xyz: gives a warning before deleting the file with the name as 'xyz'. asks for y n input from user before deleting (facing a lot of buffer issue, if doesnot work please terminate and restart the terminal) 
NOTE: if problem still persists make a new makefile
CORNER CASES HANDLED
+=++====-=-=-+++==_=_=_=_



5. cat 
FUNCTIONALITIES
cat xyz  : opens and prints the text of the file named xyz
cat abc xyz : opens and prints the text of the file named xyz and abc
CORNER CASES HANDLES
if file xyz is not found in the directory gives the output 'cat: ejhf: No such file or directory' 
if the file you try to open is a cat then it gives out the output 'cat: filename: Is a directory'



6. mkdir
1. mkdir xyz  : makes directory with the name xyz
2. mkdir --help  : prints help file for mkdir and outputs the various commands
-> mkdir xyz ufh is same as mkdir 'xyz ufh' ie: spacebar exception in name handled , mkdir --help urfh is same as mkdir --help

7. ls 
1. ls 
2. ls -a
'ls --' is treated the same as ls



8. cd
1. cd directoryname : moves to directoryname 
2. cd / : moves back to the directory we started from 
-> incorrect command gives instructions about valid cd commands
if non existant file opened gives out the warning 'cd: no such file or directory'
